Hello, I'm Ahmad Saufi Maulana, my closest people who I usually call **Upi**, I'm currently in my final year of college and I'm very happy to learn new things.

My goal in making this site is actually just for my personal documentation when I'm learning new things so I don't bother looking back and forth for reference sites, besides that I also like to write notes whether it's in the form of personal stories or just sharing recipes üçï.
